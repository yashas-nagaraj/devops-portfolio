🚀 Cloud & DevOps Engineering PortfolioAuthor: Yashas NagarajFocus: AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform, CI/CD, ObservabilityWelcome to my portfolio! This repository serves as a central index for my DevOps journey. Below you will find links to specific projects:🏗️ Project IndexProject NameTech StackKey AchievementProject LazarusJenkins, Docker, AWS EC2Automated Zero-Downtime DeploymentProject HumangasaurusAWS EKS, Kubernetes, HelmScalable Microservices MigrationProject Terra-SaurusTerraform, AWS S3, DynamoDBInfrastructure as Code (IaC)Project Eye-SaurusPrometheus, Grafana, cAdvisorFull-Stack ObservabilityProject AllsaurusTerraform, Jenkins, AWS EKS, RDS, HelmEnd-to-End 3-Tier Cloud Architecture📂 Brief Project Breakdown1. [Project Lazarus: CI/CD Pipeline Automation]Repository: stranger-things-appGoal: Eliminate manual "SSH-and-patch" deployments by building a robust CI/CD pipeline.Architecture:Source: GitHub Webhooks trigger the pipeline on commit.CI (Jenkins): Builds Docker images for Frontend/Backend and pushes to Docker Hub.CD (Shell): SSHs into the Production EC2, pulls new images, and seamlessly restarts containers.Key Challenge Solved: Implemented automated testing gates to prevent broken code from reaching production.2. [Project Humangasaurus: Kubernetes Migration]Repository: humangasaurus-k8sGoal: Migrate the Dockerized app to AWS EKS for high availability and self-healing.Key Features:Security: Decoupled database credentials using Kubernetes Secrets (etcd encryption).Networking: Configured Ingress Controllers and Load Balancers to route traffic.The "Nginx Crash" Fix: Re-engineered the frontend architecture from Server-Side Proxying to Client-Side Rendering to resolve Nginx CrashLoopBackOff issues caused by upstream DNS dependencies during startup.3. [Project Terra-Saurus: Infrastructure as Code]Repository: terra-saurusGoal: Provision the entire AWS infrastructure (VPC, EKS, RDS) using code to eliminate manual console errors.Key Features:Modules: Utilized terraform-aws-modules for VPC and EKS to ensure best practices.State Management: Implemented Remote State using AWS S3 (encrypted) and State Locking using DynamoDB to enable safe team collaboration and prevent state corruption.4. [Project Eye-Saurus: Observability Stack]Repository: eyesaurus-appGoal: Gain visibility into the application performance and resource usage.Architecture:Spy: cAdvisor collects container-level metrics (CPU, Memory).Brain: Prometheus scrapes metrics every 15 seconds.Face: Grafana dashboards visualize the health of the Microservices.5. [Project Allsaurus: End-to-End 3-Tier Architecture]Repository: allsaurusGoal: Architect and automate a complete, production-grade 3-tier application (Stranger Things Q&A app) integrating IaC, CI/CD, Kubernetes orchestration, and observability.Architecture:IaC: Terraform provisioned a custom VPC, EKS cluster (t3.small nodes), and a private, secure RDS MySQL database.CI/CD: Declarative Jenkins pipeline automating Docker image builds, dynamic LoadBalancer URL injection (sed), and Kubernetes zero-touch deployments.Observability: Deployed kube-prometheus-stack via Helm for real-time cluster and pod monitoring.Key Challenge Solved: Engineered dynamic environment variable injection for secure K8s-to-RDS authentication and bypassed aggressive Docker layer caching to ensure seamless, real-time frontend-to-backend API routing.🛠️ Core Competencies DemonstratedCloud: AWS (EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, IAM, ELB).Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes (Manifests, Services, Deployments).Automation: Jenkins (Groovy Pipelines), Terraform (HCL), Helm.Scripting: Bash, Python.Database: MySQL (Schema management, Connectivity).
